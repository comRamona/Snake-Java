This is my own version of the popular game.

#Java Application
 Source code can be found in src/.
 Download SnakeRama.jar and execute it (you need Java 7 in order to be able to play it). If you are using Ubuntu, open the command line and type "java -jar SnakeRama.jar".

#Applet version: 
Code can be found in MySnake.java

#Instructions:
 Click anywhere to start the game. Use the arrowkeys to move the snake around and collect apples. For every apple, the snake will grow one unit.
 If you hit the walls or your own tail, you will see the GameOver Screen and your score. Click anywhere to restart.
 
 A screenhost of the game can also be found in this repository.
 
 ENJOY!
